# Build plan

Phases are ordered by dependency. Steps inside a phase run in parallel, each on its own
branch off `main`, each landing through a PR. A step is done when it builds, its tests
pass, `make check` is green, and its doc note is written.

## Phase 0 — Foundation (serial, one agent)

Lands the skeleton every other step depends on.

* Go module, `Makefile`/`Taskfile` with `build`, `check` (vet, staticcheck, test), `gen`.
* `buf.yaml`, `buf.gen.yaml`, `proto/codefoundry/v1/health.proto`, committed generated code
  for Go and TS.
* `internal/paths`, `internal/daemon` with both listeners, token file, graceful shutdown,
  single-instance lock.
* `internal/bus` generic event bus with tests.
* `internal/client` with auto-start of the daemon.
* `cmd/code-foundry`: `daemon`, `status`, `version`.
* `gui/`: Wails v3 scaffold, Vite + React + TS + Tailwind + shadcn, Connect-Web client,
  token handshake, a page that renders `HealthService.Ping`.
* CI workflow: `make check` + frontend lint/test.

## Phase 1 — Stores and registry (parallel)

| Step | Scope | Proto |
|---|---|---|
| 1a Terminal | `store/terminal`: PTY + libghostty-vt actor, tee, ring buffer, snapshot serializer, `TerminalService` | `terminal.proto` |
| 1b Repo | `store/repo`: register, worktrees via `git`, status, fsnotify reconcile, `RepoService` | `repo.proto` |
| 1c GitHub | `store/gh`: `gh api graphql` PRs/checks/viewer, SQLite cache, pacing, `GhService` | `gh.proto` |
| 1d Commands | `internal/command` registry, `CommandService`, CLI verb generation from the registry, `UiService` | `command.proto`, `ui.proto` |
| 1e GUI shell | sidebar/content/footer layout, Zustand slices, palette (`cmdk`) bound to `CommandService`, keybinding map, xterm.js `TerminalRenderer` against `TerminalService` | — |

Each step owns its proto file. Steps do not edit each other's packages. Shared needs go
through `bus` or a new proto message in the owner's file.

## Phase 2 — Sessions (parallel after 1a, 1d, 1e)

* 2a `store/session`: spawn `claude`, JSONL discovery, resume, auto-naming, `SessionService`.
* 2b Status detection: pure event-driven state machine with table tests; wired into 2a.
* 2c GUI: session tree in sidebar, new-session dialog, model/effort picker, status badges,
  attach/detach on selection, needs-attention surfacing.
* 2d CLI: `new-session`, `list`, `focus`, `close`, `rename`, `fork` generated from the registry.

## Phase 3 — Supervision surface

* PR overview page per worktree (PRs, checks, merge state) from `GhService`.
* Git actions dialog (fetch, pull, push, create PR via `gh`).
* Settings, help overlay, confirm prompts.
* Packaging: signed `.app`, Homebrew tap, `code-foundry update`.

## Gates

* No step merges with a failing `make check`.
* Any change to a `v1` proto after Phase 1 is additive only.
* Memory check at the end of Phase 2: daemon + GUI with ten idle sessions attached one at a
  time, measured with `footprint`, recorded in `docs/perf.md`.
